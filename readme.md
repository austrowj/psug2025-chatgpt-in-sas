# Welcome!

Thanks for checking out my paper on using the ChatGPT API from SAS.
I hope you find it useful, or at least interesting.

Feel free to get in touch if you experience any issues or just want to discuss anything.

Also, don't mind the strange formatting markup in the notebook.
It is an artifact of my publishing process ðŸ™‚

## Getting Started

There are two main ways to use this repository:
1. Open the notebook and follow along with the paper.
2. Use the full API client directly.

Option 2 is plug and play; from within your SAS program, simply `%include "code/full_client.sas";` and refer to the paper for usage examples.

Option 1 requires that you set up Jupyterlab and SASpy.
See the next section for instructions.

In both cases, you will need to set up your API key.
Follow the instructions in the "Obtaining an API Key" section or nothing else will work.

### Setting up the Notebook
First, install the python dependencies.
In Windows:
```powershell
py -m venv .venv; .venv/Scripts/Activate; pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And in Linux:
```sh
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You will then need to configure the provided sascfg.py according to your specific system.
Refer to https://sassoftware.github.io/saspy/configuration.html for details.

After that, you should be good to go! Launch jupyter by typing
```sh
jupyter-lab
```
and open `notebook.ipynb`.

Note that the early sections include a few hardcoded file paths which almost certainly won't work out of the box for you.
Feel free to modify them or just don't run those cells.
